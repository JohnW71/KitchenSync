This is a file/folder synchronization tool for backup purposes. Set source & destination pairs, segregated into separate projects as required.

Settings allow for skipping _desktop.ini_ files as these are sometimes blocked, and also symbolic links can be skipped if required to prevent any errors.

The detection of files/folders is very thorough and painfully slow, don't be surprised if this takes a ridiculously long time to get through large folder trees. Future updates may attempt to access the MFT instead to speed things up.
